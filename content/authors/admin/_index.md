    summary: |2-
     - In this research, we focus on dynamic spatial matching problems where requests arrive stochastically, such as in car-pooling platforms. The key issue explored is the trade-off between delaying matching decisions to increase market thickness and the associated increase in user waiting times. We propose four matching policies‚ÄîGreedy, Radius, Batching, and Partition‚Äîwhich offer constant competitive ratios in comparison to the optimal offline solution. Our work provides insights into designing efficient matching policies that balance user satisfaction with market efficiency.
     - Responsible for the proofs of the lower bound on optimal cost and upper bounds on matching policies and competitive analysis. Conduct numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets for the proposed algorithms.

      This competition's framework aims to optimize supermarket vegetable pricing, ordering, and assortment decisions. To address this, a multi-stage model is used, combining time series and correlation analysis with mixed-integer programming and MNL choice models. We begin by identifying product interdependencies, then simulate risk-cost benefits for ordering strategies using clustering and historical data, and finally integrate optimization techniques to maximize profitability through product selection.

      The research framework explores AI's impact on the coal industry, focusing on supply, extraction, and utilization segments. It involves modeling and empirical analysis of these segments, a case study of the 'Huawei + Guoneng Shendong' partnership, and an assessment of policy effects on smart mining using a DID model. Industry-level impacts are evaluated with a multiple nonlinear regression model that incorporates LMDI decomposition and mediator variables to examine AI's influence on mortality rates, efficiency, and energy consumption.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China. And I'm applying for PhD programs in operations management now! My research interest is revenue management, online matching and dynamic decision-making, as well as extending the reach of operations management to social welfares such as healthcare and education. And I'm continuously exploring other topics of interest now :D
